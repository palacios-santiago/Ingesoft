Pero diste todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla
Ayo, I used to lay low
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O (Woop-woop)
Until I realized you a epic fail
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo (Ah!)
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place (Aha)
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face (Okay)
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met (Woop)
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (Woop)
Ayo! Tell 'em to back off
He wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and Karol G, we let them rats talk
Don't run up on us, 'cause they lettin' the MACs off
(Rrr!)
